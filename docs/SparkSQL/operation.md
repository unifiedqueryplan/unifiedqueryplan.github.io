title: Operations
layout: default
parent: SparkSQL

SparkSQL defines operations in spearate classes under the package `org.apache.spark.sql.execution`, and uses the class names as operation names. Therefore, we identified the operations via the linux command

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/spark
cd spark
git checkout f4e53fa9
cd sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution
find . -type f -name "*Exec.scala"| sed -n 's|.*/\([^/]*\)Exec.scala|\1|p'
```

We further manually examined the identified operations and removed three abstract base classes: `BaseAggregate`, `BaseJoin`, and `BaseScriptTransformation`, which are used for other operations and are not shown as operation names in query plans.
