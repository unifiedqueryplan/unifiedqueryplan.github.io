# Query Plan Refernces
We explain the details of the query plan study here. For each Database Management System (DBMS), we give an example of a query plan and explain the operations and properties.


## Document Structure
This document is organized as followed:
* Each DBMS takes up a sub-menu on the left side. Click the DBMS name to see the query plan example and explanation.
* Each DBMS has one or two sub-pages to show the detailed list of operations and properties.
* Each list of operations or properties includes four columns: 

| Operation/Property | Category | Reference | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw name of the operation or property | The category we assigned to the operation or property in the study | The reference link to the document or source code | THe description of the operation or property |

## Unified Query Plan Representation
We provide a EBNF grammar of the unified query plan representation. Please check the [grammar page](grammar) for more details.

## Visualization Tool
We provide a visualization tool to show the application of the unified representation of query plans. Please check the [visualization page](visualization) for more details.

## UPlan
We provide the source code of our prototype UPlan for maintaining the unified query plan representation. Please check the [UPlan page](uplan) for more details.
